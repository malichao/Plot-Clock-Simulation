# PlotClockSimulation
Wrote a simulation program for this hilarious plot clock.Program is written in C#.There's a execution in /bin/debug or you can import to MS visual studio and build your own one.

This program is good for those who want to build their own plot clock but don't know how to choose a suitable length for the arms.For how I implemented the program please go [here](http://lichaoma.com/2015/11/25/simulation-of-plot-clock-for-optimization/)

If you want the solidworks models,please go here:
